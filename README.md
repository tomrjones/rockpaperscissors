odin project creating a human vs computer rock paper scissors game

In this project I wish to demostrate my ability to use javascript, learning as I go.  I will create a man vs computer roshambo game that keeps track of wins and losses.  Further along in my process I will create a user interface that is clean and interactive.  To start I am simply focusing on the gaming aspect and using my little javascript knowledge and will build on it through trial and error as well as research.  Wish me luck!
